Welcome to box-kite! A simple static blog framework by [Chris
Penner](http://chrispenner.ca). I built this for myself to use, (mostly to
learn about the development process) but it turned out to be a pretty nice
solution. Box-kite lets you write all your posts in markdown and specify any
metadata you need in the same text-file. Any categories or tags you specify
will be automatically linked up when you generate the site. If you want to get
started right away just go clone
[http://github.com/ChrisPenner/boxkite](http://github.com/ChrisPenner/boxkite)
and go to
> boxkite/content/posts/hello-world.md

where you'll find this post! Go there now in your favourite text editor.
You can see at the top that I've listed a few things about this post:

* Title
* Author
* Date
* Tags
* Categories
* A header image
* A post description

Feel free to use this post as a basis for your future posts! Just make sure to
have at least one completely blank line between the metadata at the top and the
rest of the post. Aside from that it's just normal markdown. There's more stuff
you can do, (check out **config.py**) but read the documentation at [the github
page](http://www.github.com/ChrisPenner/boxkite) for that.
